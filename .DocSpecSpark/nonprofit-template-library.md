## Implementation Notes

### Template Customization Process

```bash
# User creates document from template
$ docspec create handbook "Employee Handbook"

# CLI prompts for placeholders
Company name: Acme Nonprofit
State: California
HR Contact: hr@acmenonprofit.org

# CLI generates:
# documents/handbooks/employee-handbook.md
# Pre-filled with metadata and placeholder values
# User edits in Markdown editor
```

### Compliance Validation (Phase 2 Idea)

Future compliance engine would:
- Check that required sections are present
- Validate against Form 990 Part VI governance questions
- Flag missing policies referenced in bylaws
- Warn about state-specific requirements

### Template Updates

When DocSpecSpark publishes updated templates:
```bash
$ docspec update
Found new template: youth-protection-policy.md
Found updated template: conflict-of-interest-policy.md (v1.0 → v1.1)

✓ Added new template to .docspecspark/templates/
✓ Updated existing template (your documents are NOT changed)

To use new template: docspec create policy "Youth Protection Policy"
```
