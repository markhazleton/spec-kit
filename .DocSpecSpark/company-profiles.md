## Profile Migration & Evolution

### Startup → Small Business
```bash
# As startup grows, migrate to small business profile
$ docspec migrate-profile --from startup --to small-business-service

Migrating profile...
✓ Adding templates: Employee Handbook, Performance Review Policy
✓ Upgrading approval workflows (2 layers)
✓ Activating compliance framework: SOC 2
✓ Enabling SharePoint integration (optional)

Migration complete. 4 new templates available, 2 workflows updated.
```

### Profile Auto-Detection
```yaml
# .docspecspark/constitution.yaml
company:
  profile: "startup"
  profile_override: false  # Allow auto-upgrade suggestions
  
  # Triggers auto-suggestion
  employee_count: 55  # Profile says "< 10", but actual is 55
  
# System suggests:
# "Your company has grown! Consider upgrading to 'small-business-service' profile."
```

## Customization Examples

### Example 1: Hybrid Profile (Manufacturing + Healthcare)
```yaml
# Medical device manufacturer
company:
  base_profile: "manufacturing"
  
compliance:
  active_frameworks:
    - id: "iso9001"  # From manufacturing
    - id: "iso13485"  # Medical devices (custom)
    - id: "fda-qsr"   # FDA Quality System Regulation
    - id: "hipaa"     # From healthcare profile
```

### Example 2: International Non-Profit
```yaml
# Non-profit operating in EU
company:
  base_profile: "not-for-profit"
  
compliance:
  active_frameworks:
    - id: "grant-compliance"
    - id: "gdpr"  # Added for EU operations
```

---

**Status**: Draft for review
**Next Steps**:
1. Create initialization wizard that prompts for profile
2. Build template bundles for each profile
3. Create migration scripts between profiles
4. Test profile defaults with sample companies
