## Situational Templates (Not Phase 1 MVP)

These are **Phase 2+ ideas** based on operations triggers:

### Aerospace/Defense
- **AS9100 Quality Management System Manual**
- **ITAR Compliance Program**
- **First Article Inspection (FAI) Procedure (AS9102)**

### Medical Devices
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 820 QMS Manual**

## Phase 1 MVP Summary

**Total Templates for Small Business Manufacturing Profile: 40**

Distribution:
- Corporate & Governance: 4 templates
- Safety & Environmental: 10 templates
- Quality & Engineering: 6 templates
- HR & Employment: 8 templates
- Finance & Tax: 3 templates
- Commercial & Legal: 4 templates
- IT & Cybersecurity: 5 templates

**All 40 templates are derived from the "Essential" and high-priority "Important" tiers** identified in KeyDocuments-SmallBusiness.md for a ~100-employee manufacturing company.

## Implementation Notes

### Template Customization Process

```bash
# User creates document from template
$ docspec create procedure "Lockout/Tagout Program"

# CLI prompts for placeholders
Company name: Acme Manufacturing
Facility: Main Plant - Toledo, OH
EHS Manager: Jane Smith

# CLI generates:
# documents/safety/lockout-tagout-program.md
# Pre-filled with metadata and placeholder values
# User edits in Markdown editor to add machine-specific procedures
```

### State-Specific Customization

Templates flagged `state_specific: true` prompt for state during creation:
- Employee Handbook (state wage/hour, leave laws)
- Background Check Policy (ban-the-box, credit check restrictions)
- At-Will Employment Language (Montana exception)
- Payroll Procedures (state tax withholding, wage payment timing)

### Compliance Validation (Phase 2 Idea)

Future compliance engine would:
- Check OSHA recordkeeping completeness (300 log entries, annual summary posting)
- Validate engineering change control references match BOM/drawing revision
- Flag missing required training for roles (LOTO authorized persons, forklift operators)
- Warn about permit expiration dates

### Template Updates

When DocSpecSpark publishes updated templates:
```bash
$ docspec update
Found regulatory change: OSHA updates to HazCom Standard
Updated template: hazard-communication-program.md (v1.0 → v1.1)

✓ Updated template in .docspecspark/templates/
✓ Your existing documents are NOT changed
✓ Review change log: .docspecspark/CHANGELOG.md

To apply updates to existing documents: Manual review recommended
```
