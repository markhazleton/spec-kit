# Spec Kit Spark v1.0.0-spark.1

A community extension of GitHub Spec Kit with constitution-powered commands for enhanced development workflows. Part of the WebSpark demonstration suite.

## Release Highlights

This release establishes the Spark release format (v1.0.0-spark.x) to clearly differentiate community enhancements from the upstream GitHub Spec Kit project. All documentation and scripts have been updated to reflect this new versioning scheme.

## Spark-Specific Features

- **Discover Constitution**: Analyze existing codebases to reverse-engineer project principles
- **PR Review Command**: Constitution-based pull request review workflow
- **Site Audit**: Comprehensive codebase auditing against constitution principles
- **Critic Command**: Adversarial risk analysis for spec artifacts
- **Extended Agent Support**: 17+ AI coding assistants supported

## Using This Release

You can use these releases with your agent of choice. We recommend using the Specify CLI to scaffold your projects, however you can download these independently and manage them yourself.
